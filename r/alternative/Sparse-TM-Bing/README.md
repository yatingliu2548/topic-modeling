# Sparse-topic-modelling
A python implementation of the sparse topic algorithm in https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-079/20-079.pdf. 

The main function is in Sp_Top.py. Use the following command to run the sparse topic algorithm on a matrix of count values. See Sp_Top.py for detailed explanations of the hyperparamters.

```
  Sp_Top(X, anchor_group = None, C0 = 0.01, C1 = [1.1], cv_rep = 50)
```
